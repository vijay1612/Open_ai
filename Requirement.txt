	•	Usage in Your Project: You use the OpenAI API to generate responses from your agents based on the tasks they perform.
	8.	Litellm:
	•	Usage in Your Project: Litellm is used for managing responses from the OpenAI API and calling completions in the agents’ tasks.
	9.	3D Printing, CAD, Injection Molding:
	•	3D Printing is a process of creating three-dimensional objects by adding material layer by layer.
	•	CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software is used to design and create precise drawings of products.
	•	Injection Molding is a manufacturing process used to produce parts by injecting material into a mold.
	•	Usage in Your Project: These technologies are mentioned for the production of Crocs plugs, highlighting methods for creating high-quality, customizable, and durable products.
	10.	E-commerce Optimization:
	•	Usage in Your Project: You discuss optimizing an online platform where customers can customize and purchase Crocs plugs.
